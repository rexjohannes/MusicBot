# MusicBot

## Setup
Setting up the MusicBot is relatively painless - just follow one of the [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/). After that, configure the bot to ensure its connection to Discord.

The main configuration file is `config/options.ini`, but it is not included by default. Simply make a copy of `example_options.ini` and rename it to `options.ini`. See `example_options.ini` for more information about configurations.
